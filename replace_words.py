# Approach:
# 1. Insert all root words from dictionary into a Trie.
# 2. For each word in the sentence:
#    - Traverse the Trie character by character.
#    - As soon as a root is matched (curr.word == True), use it to replace.
#    - If no root matches, keep the word as is.
# 3. Join the modified words to return the result.

# Time Complexity: O(M + S Ã— L)
#     M = total characters in dictionary (Trie construction)
#     S = number of words in sentence
#     L = average length of sentence words (Trie traversal per word)

# Space Complexity: O(M + S)
#     M = space for Trie
#     S = result list
